## ToSCoCPP

Yes, the Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, and Privacy Policy are all one big-ass document.
What a crazy world. Try to pronounce it? "TossCockPuhPuh". Not great. Welp.
I'm told that sites have to have these.

Throughout this document, we refer to ourselves with the royal "we".
"We" are responsible for providing you with this website. "We" might just be me,
[Cube Drone](https://cube-drone.com).

In order to use this site, you must agree to all of the terms in the ToSCoCPP,
**even the terms that contradict the other terms**.

This is version <strong>3.12345.d</strong> of the ToSCoCPP.

It's possible (nay, probable) that that some of the rules in this document may turn out
to be legally unenforceable, or "complete and utter nonsense". Should this be the case,
this doesn't invalidate any parts of this ToSCoCPP that _do_ happen to be enforceable,
and any unenforceable rules should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make
them enforceable.

If we let you (or someone else) break one of these rules for whatever reason, that
doesn't invalidate that rule, or _any other rule_.

## Rule ♡: Be Kind
> There's only one rule that I know of, babies-"God damn it, you've got to be kind.”

English is a fundamentally imprecise language and it is impossible to create a contract
that legislates your behavior around others without allowing numerous loopholes.

So let's start with this: we're here
(both "on this website" and in the broad metaphysical sense)
to have a good time, and make sure everybody else has a good time.

[Be excellent to each other. Party on, dudes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU)

## Rule 13: 13+
If you're under the age of thirteen, it becomes legally extremely difficult to offer
you any kind of online service without a whole huge regulatory framework
that protects you from everybody else online.
So most online services, myself included, will ask you to assert that you are over the
age of 13 before you use the service at all.
You weren't going to be a paying customer anyways, user-under-the-age-of-thirteen.
Don't be under 13 years of age. Don't let somebody else under the age of 13 use this site.

## Rule 18: 18+/Racy Content
Certain content on this site may be adult in nature. Wherever it's possible, we ask that you
mark that content _as such_ so that people can opt-in to seeing it.

Any pornographic content featuring underage participants is _explicitly and expressly forbidden_,
in case that isn't obviously covered by the "No Breaking The Law" rule.

Certain jurisdictions may require age verification before users are allowed to see
NSFW content on the site. It's unlikely that we will be popular enough to actually operate in
said jurisdictions (as established: all of our users are Canadian), but if you are in a country
where it would be illegal to view NSFW content on our website without age verification, doing so
is a violation of our ToS and we would ask you to kindly stop.

## Rule G: Gore/Shock Content
Violent or disturbing gore/shock content is almost as hard to define as pornography, but (at least in my opinion) not
intended to be enjoyed _at all_. Do not post it to this site.

## Rule C-0: No Breaking The Law
You may not use this website to break the law. The law in Canada. Canadian law.
Because you're a Canadian. If you're not a Canadian, you may not use this website at all,
but you _especially_ shouldn't break the law - either Canadian law _or_ the law in
whatever country you live in. Don't break _either of those laws_.
Don't upload anything that _breaks laws_, civil or criminal.

## Rule 88: No Nazis
Draw a swastika? _Instant ban_. Impersonate a hitler?
**Instant ban**. Heil **anything**? Instant ban.

## Rule N: The One Word That Will Definitely Get You Banned
You know what word it is, and it will definitely get you banned.

## Rule 22: Accounts Are Non-Transferable
You can only use your own account. Don't use anybody else's account.
Don't sell accounts, buy accounts, trade accounts, accounts are **non-transferable**.
If I catch you transferring accounts, I'm gonna do a bunch of _account deleting_.

## Rule For Rent: No Advertising/Spam
This is not the place to advertise yourself or your product, or solicit, or hustle.

## Rule AI: Only Some-Human-Effort Content Is Allowed
This is kind of a fuzzy rule but low-effort/automated content is not allowed, here.

## Rule 0: No Impersonations
You may not falsely imply that you’re affiliated with or endorsed by us.

Also you shouldn't impersonate anybody else on the site? Be yourself.

## Rule `</div>`: No Scraping, Breaking, Scanning, or Load Testing
Don't point any kind of automated script at this site -
automated access, monitor, crawler, load tester, _anything_,
without explicit permission &mdash; unless you're Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing.

Causing any kind of noticeable strain on the servers is grounds for a ban.

## Rule 45: No Stochastic Rule-Breaking
You may not encourage or help anyone else to violate these rules.

## You Wouldn't Download a Rule: This Is Not A Piracy Site
If you don't own the copyright to a thing, you shouldn't
post it here. Pirated movies, software, or music are definitely out of the
question and if you post those things you're definitely going to have a bad time.

## Rule Citation: Don't Steal
Definitely don't file someone else's watermark off of a thing and post it as your own.

## Rule 604-533-9383: No Doxxing
Anything you post here must be respectful of the privacy of others.
Don't post personally-identifying-information about anybody.

You may not use the forum to disclose information that you don’t have the right
to disclose, like others’ confidential or personal information.

## Rule H4XX: No Viruses or Spyware
Don't ... post viruses or spyware? Obviously that is not allowed.

## Rule 6: Inactive Accounts Will Be Deleted
If you don't log in at least once every **three years**,
we're gonna clear you out to make room for more users.

## Rule 1-1: On Average You Should Have About One Account
By and large an appropriate number of accounts per user is "just one".
You may not have more than one account.

## Rule T: Threat Level Midnight
Do not threaten other users.  Do not use this site as a venue to threaten anybody
outside of this site. A threat doesn't just need to be "with bodily harm",
you can also run afoul of this rule by threatening to dox, harass, hack,
or otherwise menace users.

## Rule ♔: Your Account Is Belong To Us
Some of the features of this site won't work if you don't have an account.

We can close your account at any time, for any reason we want.
If we do close your account for any reason _other_ than "inactivity",
you are cordially invited *not to return*. Should you return after having your
account removed on purpose, you will be treated as a malicious user.

## Rule ∞: Don't Make Me Add A Rule
If you find a new and creative way to be awful, I'm just going to add a new rule.

## Rule C: Your Content Remains Your Content

If you give us any information - your name, your information, anything you post -
we don't own _any of that_. That's all still yours.
But you **do** grant us permission to share, copy, publish, analyze,
and otherwise befingerpoke anything you provide to us.

This license is, as far as we can tell, pretty necessary: without it, we couldn't
share your content with anybody else, which would probably make for a pretty
boring website.

That special license dies when we delete our last copy of whatever that data is.

You are entirely responsible for anything you post. We are not under any
obligation to store, maintain, change, or do _anything_ to your content.

If people get your content from this site, and go on to violate _your_
license terms, that's not our problem. You agree that we will not be liable to you
for any such asshattery.

## Rule ER: The Inventory Management in Earthbound is Bad
Look, Earthbound is an all-time classic game but the limited inventory space and managing
Ness's inventory was, is, and remains a huge pain in the ass.

## Rule Enforcement
We may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest
legal extent. We may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities
in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.

We reserves the right to change, redact, and delete any content on this site,
for any reason, whenever we want. If you believe that somebody has broken a rule,
please contact us immediately at `moderation.for.serious@gooble.email`.

## Contract Nonsense:  Indemnification, No Warranty, and Breach of Contract

This one's hard to read, but kind of important to reproduce as-is:

> You agree to indemnify us from legal claims by others related to your breach of these
> terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the site.
> Both you and us agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which
> you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.
> You agree to allow us to control investigation, defense, and settlement
> of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify us, and to cooperate
> with those efforts. We agree not to agree to any settlement that admits
> fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.
>
> ***You accept all risk of using the site and content on the site.
> As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the site as is,
> without any warranty whatsoever.***
>
> ***We will not  be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages that our
> personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.***
>
> You may not assign your agreement with the company.

tl;dr-ing is pretty risky when it comes to legal stuff of this caliber
(I don't understand indemnity, do you?),
so you'll have to figure these lines out on your own.

## This Is Ridiculous
A pretty standard part of a Terms of Service is to note that - if we
hyperlink to other content that's not run by _us_, we are not responsible for
that content. That's how _hyperlinks work_.
You follow them to get to _other websites_, run by _people who are not us_.
We're not responsible for that.

## Termination
You can leave at any time, we can kick you out at any time, and if
that happens all of these terms remain in effect.
If you leave, you can come back whenever you want.
If we kick you out, you are no longer allowed to use this site.

## Disputes
British Columbian Law will govern any dispute related to these terms or
your use of this product.

You agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in provincial
or federal court in British Columbia, Canada. You will not object to jurisdiction,
forum, or venue in those courts.

In any disputes with us, you agree to be an individual, not a _class_.
I don't want to be in any class action lawsuits, you hear? No thank you.

## Privacy & Data Storage
If you're just cruising through this site as a random stranger, we keep a
small amount of log data on you for no more than 7 days - probably your
IP address and information about your browser -
but otherwise you're dust in the wind to us.

Once you create an account, we save more information about you - any
information you give us explicitly (such as your chosen display
name and your email address) as well as transient information
about your connection (your IP address, some information about your browser).
We keep this data semi-permanently, although,
if you are away from the site for more than 3 years we will purge that data automatically.

When you're logged in, we save a piece of random identifying data about you,
in your browser, in a cookie. This is so that we know that you're logged in,
and that you're you. We don't share that information with _anybody_.
We certainly don't use that information to track your behavior across
dozens of sites, compiling an incredible invasive dossier about you
that we can use to laser-target advertising to you, you know, like
some other companies do.

We don't use any ad-network products to track you.

We will endeavor to collect as little data about you as is reasonably possible,
but if someone offers us a life-changing amount of money to sell them
the entire company, we will do it in a _heartbeat_ because we would
like to _retire early_. Your best defense against this particular outcome
is to make me so rich *before that happens* that I can retire without having
to sell my website. 😎  Please consider it.

## Rules That I'm Sneaking In, That You Probably Shouldn't Read Carefully
<small>
Rule 0:  No Using The Site At All.
You are not allowed to use this website. At all. For any reason.
You're not even allowed to read this ToSCoCPP.
Any and all access to this site whatsoever is considered unauthorized.
If you continue to use this site, I reserve the right to have you prosecuted
according to Canadian Criminal Code C-42, Section 342 at any time that I want.

Rule 1: In order to use the site (which you are not, of course, allowed to use at all)
you must be **in Canada**. I'm just one man, so I can't enforce this terribly closely,
so _honor system_. We're all Canadians, here.

Rule 2: You give me full and unhampered permission to rummage around in your underwear drawer.

Rule 3: If you are holding a big sandwich and it is lookin' tasty, and I ask you for a
bite of that sandwich, you are required to hand over that big sando for a period of time
no shorter than 90 seconds, giving me an opportunity to get a big ol' bite of that top notch
bread-boy.
</small>

## Changes
This agreement may change at any time. If it does, we'll e-mail you
(if you've provided us with an e-mail) to let you know about the changes.
 You must always have agreed to whatever the current ToSCoCPP is in order to use the site.
