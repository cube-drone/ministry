## Pricing?

it doesn't cost any money

### You Need Some Kind of Business Model, Obviously

not yet I don't

### Look, I need some kind of assurance you aren't going to get me all invested in your platform and then pull the rug out from me by introducing some predatory monetization model, that's why I was looking for pricing information in the first place

Ok, here's the deal, if you're one of the first, say, 5000 users to the site, I will add a special flag to your account that will allow you to use all of the site features for free in perpetuity so long as this site stays online.

You're, uh, _foundational_ users.

I'll remove this FAQ entry as soon as it isn't an option any more, so, If you're still reading this, that deal is still on the table. _quickly, go make an account!_

There's something like a 99.9% chance that this site will never have more than 5000 users, so once I hit that critical juncture - things'll still be free for _you_, the early adopters, and I'll start trying to figure out how to make those new folk pay to keep the lights on and whatnot.

In that incredibly unlikely event, well, the site's built in Rust, there's just the one of me, and overheads are super low, so the site's not likely to become very very expensive to maintain. Maybe I'll start a Patreon? Who knows.

### Doesn't that, like, really encourage users to create as many new accounts as possible as quickly as possible to hoard and eventually sell them?

Kinda, yeah. But don't do that, though.
