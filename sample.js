* command an active servant who handles most of the details of their survival
* will occasionally make a huge mess, expect you to clean it up
* recreationally do murders for the sheer thrill of the hunt
* sometimes very friendly, sometimes very cold, seemingly unpredictably

me, to tiff: if a vampire wanted a fizzy drink would they have to go after scuba divers and intentionally give them the bends?

tiff: couldn't they just extract the blood and add carbon dioxide directly? I mean, unless this is Ann Rice rules

me: I mean, nitrogen works to make the stout all foamy, that's also what's happening to scuba divers, right?

tiff: it only takes, like, a few bubbles to kill you, I don't think the vampires could move the scuba divers fast enough to make this satisfying

I'm on a rewatch of ALL OF SCRUBS and...

I used to watch this show _all of the time_ while I was doing homework in university.

Seasons 1-4? Don't hold up so well. They definitely spend a lot of time in the same sitcom gutter: J.D. struggles in his relationship with a skinny blonde girl and/or pines over Eliot. J.D. has to learn to be a better doctor. Dr. Cox has to learn to be 5% less mean. Dr. Cox teaches J.D. how to be a better doctor. Turk and Carla have a simple couple-fight that resolves easily by the end of the episode. Eliot learns self confidence!

Dr. Cox calls J.D. a girl's name. That's a running joke for many seasons. It's **never** good, or funny.

At the end of the episode, something a little bit sad or thoughtful happens, some alt-rock plays, and J.D. does a voiceover narration where he talks about the lessons he learned.

From Seasons 4 forward we get a handful of skinny girls who _aren't_ blonde, which is... kind of a step forward?

Seasons 5-8 hold up Pretty Well! They're fun, they focus a lot more on the ensemble cast than on J.D., and they pull some funny meta-moves. The seasons-long redemption arc of Bob Kelso starts here, too, which is good because he is legitimately one of the funnier characters on the show. Leaning on the ensemble cast also gives also pulls focus _away_ from the standard story-line gutter where a lot of the early seasons spend so much of their time.

Season 7 confused me, again. There's a weird time-skip where the putative Season Finale is actually a mostly pointless mid-season bottle episode that breaks causality rules and _must have happened before the episodes that came before it_. I'm pretty sure this is a network-airing-it-out-of-intended-order error. This is a combination of "writer's strike" and "NBC cancelled the show" so a bunch of stuff that's supposed to happen just disappears.

Turk, Carla, and Kelso are _reliably_ the funniest characters on the show. J.D. and Turk being best friends is also reliably very good.

As a hold-out from some of the earlier seasons, J.D. relentlessly and jealously torments Eliot's boyfriend Keith for much of Season 5/6, and _wow_ this didn't age well. It just makes J.D. seem petty, shallow, and cruel, and also because J.D. is in a position of power over Keith at the hospital, this is _quite illegal_.

For the entire runtime of the show, it often ping-pongs between being weirdly obsessed with sex and death, which was a better fit for me in my early twenties than it is for me in my late thirties.

I still don't know what "pushing thrombolytics" means. I've looked it up _so many times_.

The unexpected musical episode is the greatest unexpected musical episode of any television show ever made. (That's right, even you, Buffy, you don't have the lyrical masterpiece "Everything Comes Down To Poo", which I have been humming continuously for a decade and a half.)

I think "The Todd" is the only openly bisexual male character I've _ever_ seen on network television.

Behold, tact and sensitivity in a character who is in no way played for laughs:

One of my favorite episodes is the one where Doug discovers that his years of being a terrible doctor make him a top-notch coroner, on account of having first-hand experience with entirely too many fatal mistakes.  I really like it when a character's flaws or quirks become unexpected strengths.

Pairing up extremely-middle-aged Ted with at-the-time early-twenty-something Kate Micucci was and remains gross. This is a 20-year age difference.

Season 9, of course, does not and never did exist.
